# Fairy Trail in p5.js

This sketch tracks people within the webcam and follows them with particle system explosions. Each person has a different color for their particle system, and the color will change each time there is a lapse in people detected (meaning it won't be the same color every time for the first person it detects). When idle (when there are no people detected), it will randomly have little particle system explosions across the width and height of the screen.
